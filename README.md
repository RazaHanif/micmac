# 🧠 Raza's Learning Vault
[![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/RazaHanif/micmac)](https://github.com/RazaHanif/micmac/commits/main)

Welcome to my personal coding vault, 
I called it micmac because I mainly use my MacBook to code, micmac = McMac without any cease and desist from McDonalds.

This folder is where I keep all the code and learning materials I've collected while studying computer science and software engineering. 
It's a mix of course assignments, personal projects, experiments, and useful tutorials — basically everything I've used to learn how to code.

It gets used now days really only for me to copy the css on how to center a div. yikes.

Exciting times ahead! 
I'm now dedicating my efforts to being a basic unemployed comp sci grad and creating an AI-powered SaaS product.

## 🧾 Notes

This repo is not meant to be a polished product — it's raw, unfiltered and barely makes sense to me sometimes. 
Feel free to explore.
