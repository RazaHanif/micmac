Welcome to my personal coding vault! 
This folder is where I keep all the code and learning materials I've collected while studying computer science and software engineering. 

It's a mix of course assignments, personal projects, experiments, and useful tutorials — basically everything I've used to learn how to code.

## 🎓 What’s This Folder For?

This folder is a living, growing archive of:
- Experiments and projects I have built
- Practice with testing, version control, and fullstack development
- Prep for building my own SaaS project (coming soon)

---

## 🚀 Coming Soon

In the next few weeks (as of March 2025), I’ll be transitioning to building a full-fledged SaaS product. 
This folder will stop getting regular updates as I will be focusing on:
- Project planning docs
- SaaS MVP builds
- Backend APIs and frontend UIs
- Deployment and CI/CD experiments

## 🧾 Notes

This repo is not meant to be a polished product — it's raw, unfiltered learning in progress. Feel free to explore or fork anything useful.
