UX/UI

Single page applications
    having the webpage stay static without multiple routes,
    but using js adding/removing from the DOM

Window/Document
    Document is the whole webpage
    Window is the users current view of the webpage

    Get size of the window
        window.innerHeight
        window.innerWidth
    
    Get info about of scroll
        window.scrollY - returns pixels from top
        document.body.offsetHeight - returns total pixels of page

    You can use these to findout if the user is at the bottom of the page

    if (document.body.offsetHeight >= 
        window.innerHeight + window.scrollY)
        User is at the bottom of the page

    good use of this is to add infinite scroll to website
    once you start to near the end of the page async load new content
    to add to the bottom of the page
