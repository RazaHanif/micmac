CarMD Api for car maintaince -- add that very last cuz gonna have to pay for the api acess

------------
Start using r = response["results"]  to make loops and all easier and less work to type out
------------

geocoder to get the current long/lat for the local shop recomendation

SerpApi for the google maps search integration
--- go through the sample response to build up the website before actually pulling requests

Maybe switch this to just the actual google api cuz I feel like thats more future proof
