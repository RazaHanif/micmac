Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: I predicited that more simulations would = more time in a linear fashion.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: I would call the 1000 simulations 'good enough'
